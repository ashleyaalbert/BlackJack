## Project Information
We are creating the classic poker game, Black Jack! The rules of Black Jack are simple.
The object of the game is to get your cards to equal to 21. Although you cannot trade your
cards with the dealer or other players. You can hit to receive another card from the dealer, or
you can split your hand to turn a bad hand into two possible winning hands.  Although if you
think you got the dealer beat you can stand and hold your cards as is. Just don't get 
over 21! If you bust you lose!
